# Mission & Philosophy

Open Source Software (OSS), and the global community around it, has been one of the key driving forces of innovation for the past 3 decades.
Communities of smart and motivated individuals contribute their time and knowledge to further the research and developments of open source, which is available for everyone to use and build upon.

The same is happening with the rapidly growing field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, AI has a unique barrier to entry. Running inference and training the of larger models requires access to high-performance compute and GPU systems that can cost hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars.
Tens of thousands of smart and motivated people around the world are capable of contributing their knowledge and experiance to the furtherance of open source AI, but don't have the resources to do so.

GPU-Poor-No-More is an effort to build a platform where open source community members can come to run, train, and evaluate models.

# Core Principles

1. Use of resources is for open community research and evaluation that is intended to be shared with the AI community in an open way. It is not intended to be used for closed or proprietary development. Where possible, efforts should be made to ensure this is the case.
2. The platform should allow "Self-Service" abilities, but be constrained on the time and amount of resources used by an individual. Exceptions can be made for large numbers of resources and/or extended times.
3.
